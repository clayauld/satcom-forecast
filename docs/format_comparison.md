## üÜï Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Summary Format (June 2025)
The Summary format has been completely redesigned for better usability:

- **Time-Based Format**: Shows exactly when weather events occur
- **Probability Included**: Each event shows its likelihood percentage
- **Pipe Separators**: Clean visual separation between time periods
- **Single Message Delivery**: Always fits in one email (under 200 characters)
- **Prioritized Events**: Shows most significant weather conditions first

### Fixed FULL Format (June 2025)
The FULL format has been improved to prevent truncation issues:

- **Increased Character Limit**: Now supports 2000+ characters
- **Smart Truncation**: Cuts at sentence boundaries when needed
- **No Mid-Sentence Cuts**: Always shows complete sentences
- **Better Readability**: Complete meteorological information

### Enhanced Weather Detection (All Formats)
All three formats now use the same enhanced weather detection logic:

- **Multi-Season Support**: Rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, wind, hail, thunderstorms
- **Fog Detection**: Fog, patchy fog, dense fog, haze, mist
- **Extreme Event Detection**: Blizzard, ice storm, tornado, hurricane, severe thunderstorm, high wind warning, flood warning, dense fog
- **Smart Inference**: Provides meaningful percentages when NOAA doesn't specify them
- **Visual Highlighting**: Extreme events marked with üö®

### Multi-Region Testing
The system has been tested across diverse weather conditions:

- **Alaska (Fairbanks)**: Summer conditions with rain, thunderstorms, fog, wildfire smoke
- **Alaska (Anchorage)**: Coastal conditions with rain, fog, moderate temperatures
- **Florida (Miami)**: Hurricane season with wind, rain, thunderstorms
- **Illinois (Chicago)**: Spring conditions with rain, thunderstorms
- **Massachusetts (Boston)**: Summer heat wave with rain, thunderstorms
- **California (Los Angeles)**: Spring conditions with fog, patchy fog

This provides much more actionable information for users planning outdoor activities across all seasons and weather conditions, with the Summary format now being the most efficient for single-message delivery.
