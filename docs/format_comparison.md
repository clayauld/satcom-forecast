### Multi-Region Testing
The system has been tested across diverse weather conditions:

- **Alaska (Fairbanks)**: Summer conditions with rain, thunderstorms, fog, wildfire smoke
- **Alaska (Anchorage)**: Coastal conditions with rain, fog, moderate temperatures
- **Florida (Miami)**: Hurricane season with wind, rain, thunderstorms
- **Illinois (Chicago)**: Spring conditions with rain, thunderstorms
- **Massachusetts (Boston)**: Summer heat wave with rain, thunderstorms
