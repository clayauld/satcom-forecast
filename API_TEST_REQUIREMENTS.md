# Weather.gov API Test Implementation - Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Project**: SatCom Forecast API Migration Test
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a test version of the Weather.gov API approach to replace the current HTML web scraping method in the SatCom Forecast system. The migration aims to improve reliability, data accuracy, and maintainability while preserving existing functionality and output formats.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background
The current SatCom Forecast system uses HTML web scraping to extract weather forecast data from the National Weather Service (NWS) web interface. This approach is fragile, maintenance-intensive, and vulnerable to website structure changes. The Weather.gov API provides a stable, structured alternative that offers better reliability and data access.

### 1.2 Objectives
- **Primary**: Implement a test version of the Weather.gov API integration
- **Secondary**: Maintain 100% compatibility with existing output formats
- **Tertiary**: Improve system reliability and reduce maintenance burden

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- [ ] API integration successfully fetches forecast data
- [ ] All three output formats (Summary, Compact, Full) produce identical results
- [ ] Error handling matches or improves upon current implementation
- [ ] Performance is equal to or better than current system
- [ ] Code is maintainable and well-documented
